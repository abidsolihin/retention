# Customer Retention & Churn Insights Dashboard

Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn trends and retention insights using **Tableau**. The dashboard provides a data-driven approach to understanding customer attrition patterns, identifying high-risk segments, and optimizing retention strategies.

Key Objectives
- Calculate overall **churn rate** and retention performance.
- Identify **churn trends by tenure, contract type, and payment methods**.
- Analyze **monthly charges and their impact on customer churn**.
- Provide **interactive filters and visual insights** for better decision-making.

Dashboard Visuals
- **Churn Rate Overview (Bar Chart)** â€“ Displays the overall percentage of churned vs. retained customers.
- **Churn by Monthly Charges (Box Plot)** â€“ Shows how different pricing levels influence churn.
- **Churn by Tenure (Line Chart)** â€“ Analyzes churn trends based on customer lifespan.
- **Churn by Contract Type (Bar Chart)** â€“ Highlights how contract types affect retention.
- **Churn by Payment Method (Bar Chart)** â€“ Examines payment preferences linked to churn rates.

Tools & Technologies
- **Data Visualization:** Tableau Public Desktop
- **Data Source:** Customer churn dataset (real-world telecom/business data)
- **Data Processing:** Pre-processed and cleaned for visualization
